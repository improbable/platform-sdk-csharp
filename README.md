[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/72262ae19b377e0bb4b73b28a6e364eb903cc617cd7de9a962.svg)](https://buildkite.com/improbable/platform-sdk-csharp-nightly)

This repository contains both the source code of the Platform SDK C# and a collection of common scenarios that demonstrate how to interact with the SpatialOS Platform SDK using the SDK.

*Note: A copy of [SpatialOS blank_project](https://github.com/spatialos/BlankProject) is checked in as an example to use with some scenarios. If you are looking for SpatialOS starter projects, please visit [SpatialOS GitHub](https://github.com/spatialos).*

## Example scenarios

The design of the SDK is driven by scenarios we want to enable for our users. For detailed implementations of these scenarios, please visit [the examples directory](examples). You can use the scenarios as a quick way to experiment with the SDK.

## Targeted framework

The C# SDK is currently built targeting .NET Framework 4.5.1 and .NET Standard 1.5. As a result, it will work on all supported platforms.

## Contributing

We are currently not accepting external contributions. However, we're keen to hear what you think, so if you have any suggestions for improvements, please raise a GitHub issue and we will respond to it.
