[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/72262ae19b377e0bb4b73b28a6e364eb903cc617cd7de9a962.svg)](https://buildkite.com/improbable/platform-sdk-csharp-nightly)

This repository contains both the source code of the Platform SDK C# and a collection of common scenarios that demonstrate how to interact with the SpatialOS Platform SDK using the SDK.

*Note: A copy of [SpatialOS blank_project](https://github.com/spatialos/BlankProject) is checked in as an example to use with some scenarios. If you are looking for SpatialOS starter projects, please visit [SpatialOS GitHub](https://github.com/spatialos).*

## Example scenarios

The design of the SDK is driven by scenarios we want to enable for our users. It makes sense to showcase how to implement those scenarios in the SDK. For detailed implementation, please visit [the examples directory](examples). You can also use it as a quick way to experiment with the SDK.

## Targeted framework

The C# SDK is currently built targeting .NET Framework 4.5.1 and .NET Standard 1.5. As a result, it will work on all supported platform.

## Contributing
